	<p>During the 2023 school year I accomplished many things academically and succeeded in all my classes, even the challenging ones. This year I challenged myself with taking honors chemistry and an APCSP class. In both of those classes I was able to succeed with hard work being put into both of those classes. This school year taught me lessons about hard work and perseverance especially in school because with hard work you can do anything and succeed in anything you want.</p>
